At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates,
and youâ€™ll need to ensure your calculations are as precise as possible.

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to U.S. dollars.
Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have, and prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro.
Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars.

The formula for currency conversion is

amount_to = (amount_from * rate_from) / rate_to

where

amount_to is the amount in U.S. dollars.
amount_from is the amount in euros.
rate_from is the current exchange rate in euros.
rate_to is the current exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.

Example

How many euros are you exchanging? 81
What is the exchange rate? 137.51
81 euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is
111.38 U.S. dollars.

Constraints
Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
Use a single output statement.
